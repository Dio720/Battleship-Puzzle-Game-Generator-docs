Project Battleship Puzzle Generator</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md1"></a>
1. Introduction</h2>
<p>In the <b>Battleship Puzzle Generator</b> (<code>bpg</code>) programming assignment your team should create a set of distinct Battleship puzzles and write them to an output file.</p>
<p>The quantity of puzzles and their dimensions should be specified by the user through <b>command line arguments</b>.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md2"></a>
2. The Battleship Puzzle</h2>
<p>A Battleship puzzle is composed of two entities: a <code>n x m</code> grid matrix of cells that represents the puzzle board (i.e., the ocean), and; a set of ships (<em>armada</em>) that must be arranged on the matrix board according to some rules.</p>
<p>For this project, in particular, a valid puzzle matrix may have any dimensions between $7$ and $16$ for both rows or columns. The armada is composed of $10$ ships that your automatic generator needs to place on the matrix board. These ships are:</p>
<ul>
<li>01 Battleship, with length = $4$ cells.</li>
<li>02 Destroyers, with length = $3$ cells.</li>
<li>03 Cruisers, with length = $2$ cells.</li>
<li>04 Submarines, with length = $1$ cells.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each ship occupies their length in contiguous cells of the grid, arranged either <em>horizontally</em> or <em>vertically</em>. The ships are positioned in such a way that there are always cells representing water (i.e. unoccupied free cells) around any two ships. In other words, a ship must not occupy a cell that is neighbour of another ship's cell, not even diagonally. A ship may touch the edge of the matrix.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md3"></a>
3. The Assignment</h2>
<p>You team should devise a data structure to <b>represent</b> a puzzle and a <b>strategy</b> (algorithm) to automatically arrange the armada's ship on a board to form a valid Battleship puzzle. Your program should generate as many puzzles as the user requested, up to a maximum of $100$ puzzles. The output should be send to two output files, described later in the Output Section.</p>
<p>Discuss with your partner which is the best approach to <em>represent</em> and <em>arrange</em> ships on the board, since one decision is intrinsically connected to the other.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md4"></a>
4. Input</h2>
<p>The program should run in a terminal as follows:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">$ ./bpg [&lt;options&gt;] &lt;number_of_puzzles&gt;</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>If the user provides any wrong input or calls the program with no parameters, the application should display the proper error message (if that is the case) and print out the help as follows:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">$ ./bpg</div>
<div class="line">Usage: [&lt;options&gt;] &lt;number_of_puzzles&gt;</div>
<div class="line">  Program options are:</div>
<div class="line">    --rows &lt;num&gt;    Specify the number of rows for the matrix,</div>
<div class="line">                        with `&lt;num&gt;` in the range [7, 16 ].</div>
<div class="line">                        The default value is 10.</div>
<div class="line">    --cols &lt;num&gt;    Specify the number of columns for the matrix,</div>
<div class="line">                        with `&lt;num&gt;` in the range [7,16].</div>
<div class="line">                        The default value is 10.</div>
<div class="line">  Requested input is:</div>
<div class="line">    number_of_puzzles   The number of puzzles to be generated,</div>
<div class="line">                        in the range [1,100].</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>Note that the option parameters <em>may be specified in any order</em>, and the user may want puzzles with number of rows different from the number of columns.</p>
<p>In the situation below, the user wants $30$, <code>10x10</code> puzzles. Because the user omitted the dimensions, the application assumes the default values, which is $10$ for both dimensions.</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">$ ./bpg 30</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>If the user provides invalid input, for instance, we should print the error message and the help, as follows:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">$.\bpg 20 --rows 5</div>
<div class="line">bpg ERROR: ``invalid number of rows!``</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Usage: [&lt;options&gt;] &lt;number_of_puzzles&gt;</div>
<div class="line">  Program options are:</div>
<div class="line">    --rows &lt;num&gt;    Specify the number of rows for the matrix,</div>
<div class="line">                        with `&lt;num&gt;` in the range [7, 16 ].</div>
<div class="line">                        The default value is 10.</div>
<div class="line">    --cols &lt;num&gt;    Specify the number of columns for the matrix,</div>
<div class="line">                        with `&lt;num&gt;` in the range [7,16].</div>
<div class="line">                        The default value is 10.</div>
<div class="line">  Requested input is:</div>
<div class="line">    number_of_puzzles   The number of puzzles to be generated,</div>
<div class="line">                        in the range [1,100].</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md5"></a>
5. Output</h2>
<p>Your program should be able to produce <b>two</b> types of output files.</p>
<p>The first one is called <code>the matrix-format</code>. It contains an ascii representations of the entire board for each puzzle, so we can see the location and orientation of each individual ship on the matrix-board. This is a convenient way of visualising the puzzles. Each puzzle should be separated by a blank line. The columns and rows must all have numbers to help identify each ship's coordinate.</p>
<p>The second format is called <code>the armada-format</code>. It contains a compact text representation for each puzzle. Each individual puzzle has 10 lines, one for each ship. A line has 4 fields separeted by a white space or tab: the first field is a single character representing the ship's type, the next two fields are two integers representing the row-column coordinates of the first piece of the ship, and the last field is a single character representing the ship's orientation. In this format, we assume that all pieces of a ship are either placed towards the right of the ship's origin coordinate when in a horizontal orientation; or towards the bottom of the ship's origin coordinate when in a vertical orientation.</p>
<p>Here is an example of each type of output the should be created by the application. In this case we have generated 20, <code>12x12</code> puzzles, that you may access <a href="output/puzzles_matrix.bp">here</a> and <a href="output/puzzles_armada.bp">here</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is the matrix-format.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="./pics/matrix.png" alt="" width="150" class="inline"/></p>
<ul>
<li>This is the corresponding armada-format.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="./pics/armada.png" alt="" width="60" class="inline"/></p>
<p>The first two lines of both file formats are similar. The first line contains an integer representing the number of puzzles present in the file. The second line is composed of two integers separated by a white space of tab, and they correspond to the dimensions (i.e. row and columns) of the puzzles created by the application.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md6"></a>
5. Modeling</h2>
<p>One of the challenges in this assignment is to learn how to model the problem into the Object Oriented (OO) paradigm.</p>
<p>One of the central concepts in any OO design is the <b>class</b> entity. Recall that a class is an abstract representation of an entity involved in the problem we need to solve. A class comprehends the data necessary to represent the state of some entity, and a set of operations to manipulate its internal data and to communicate with other classes from the design model of the problem. In short, a class emulates the (abstract) behavior the application requires from that entity.</p>
<p>For this particular problem, you may chose to create the following classes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Cell</code>: A cell is a simple <code>struct</code> that represents a location within a puzzle board.</li>
<li><code>Ship</code>: A class to represent an individual ship, characterized by its type, location, and orientation within the board.</li>
<li><code>Board</code>: This class represents the battleship puzzle board, which has dimensions and contains the armada. It must receive <code>Ships</code> and stored them on the board.</li>
<li><code>Generator</code>: This class represents the "intelligence" responsible for placing each ship of the armada on the board. It must respect the placement rules and avoid mistakes such as placing ships on top of each other, partially or totally outside the board, or placing boards too close (adjacent) to one another.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Important: Each puzzle generated during an execution (batch) must be unique.</b></p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md7"></a>
6. Assignment Evaluation</h2>
<p>The project has a total of $15$ credits, distributed as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Provides the correct textual user interface, as requested in this specification: $1$ credit</li>
<li>Reads and validates the input information correctly from the command line: $2$ credit</li>
<li>Creates puzzles with the dimensions requested in this specification: $2$ credits</li>
<li>Generates <code>n</code> distinct puzzles, as requested by the user: $6$ credits</li>
<li>Generates two output files: $4$ credits</li>
</ol>
<p>Obviously, to get full credits on each item previously described here your program must execute them correctly.</p>
<p>The following situations may <b>take credits out</b> of your assignment, if they happen during the evaluation process:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Compiling and/or run time errors (up to -2 credits)</li>
<li>Missing code documentation in Doxygen style (up to -1 credit)</li>
<li>Memory leak (up to -1 credits)</li>
<li>Missing <code>author.md</code> file (up to -1 credits).</li>
</ol>
<p>The <code>author.md</code> file written in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> file format should contain a brief description of the game, and how to run it. It also should describe possible errors, limitations, or issues found. Do not forget to include the author(s) name(s)!</p>
<p>Extra credits may be awarded to those assignments which have able to create another program that reads the input puzzle file and display an interactive game. An example of such interface may be found online <a href="https://dkmgames.com/Yubotu">here</a>.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md8"></a>
6.1 Good Programming Practices</h3>
<p>During the development process of your assignment, it is strongly recommend to use the following tools:-</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Doxygen: professional code documentation;</li>
<li>Git: version control system;</li>
<li>Valgrind: tracks memory leaks, among other features;</li>
<li>gdb: debugging tool, and;</li>
<li>Makefile: helps building and managing your programming projects.</li>
</ol>
<p>Try to organize you code in several folders, such as <code>src</code> (for <code>.cpp</code> and <code>.h</code> files), <code>build</code> (for executable files) and <code>data</code> (for storing output files).</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md9"></a>
6.2 Authorship and Collaboration Policy</h3>
<p>This is a pair assignment. You may work in a pair or alone. If you work as a pair, comment both members' names atop every code file, and try to balance evenly the workload. Only one of you should submit the program via Sigaa.</p>
<p>Any team may be called for an interview. The purpose of the interview is twofold: to confirm the authorship of the assignment and to identify the workload assign to each member. During the interview, any team member should be capable of explaining any piece of code, even if he or she has not written that particular piece of code. After the interview, the assignment's credits may be re-distributed to better reflect the true contribution of each team member.</p>
<p>The cooperation among students is strongly encouraged. It is accepted the open discussion of ideas or development strategies. Notice, however, that this type of interaction should not be understood as a free permission to copy and use somebody else's code. This is may be interpreted as plagiarism.</p>
<p>Any two (or more) programs deemed as plagiarism will automatically receive <b>zero</b> credits, regardless of the real authorship of the programs involved in the case. If your project uses a (small) piece of code from someone else's, please provide proper acknowledgment in the README file.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md10"></a>
6.3 Work Submission</h3>
<p>Both team members must submit a single zip file containing the entire project via SIGAA before the deadline. This should be done only via the proper link in the SIGAA's virtual class. <b>Submission via email shall be ignored!</b></p>
<p>The same project must, also, be commited before the same deadline to the proper GitHub repository created by the GitHub Classroom assignment.</p>
<p>Any commits made after the deadline will make your project be evaluated as a <b>later submission</b>. This means that your project's grade will probably be reduced, even if the project is completely correct. </p>
